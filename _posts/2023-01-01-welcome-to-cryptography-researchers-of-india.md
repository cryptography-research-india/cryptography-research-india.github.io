Welcome to Cryptography Researchers of India!

We are a platform for people passionate about research on cryptography - both academic and industrial - to connect with like-minded researchers in the field. Our goal is to facilitate collaboration and inspire interdisciplinary ideas within the community.

Cryptography is an ever-evolving field, and we aim to cover a wide range of topics within it. This includes everything from symmetric key cryptography and public key cryptography, to secure multiparty computation and homomorphic encryption. We also plan to delve into more specialized areas such as zero knowledge proofs and post-quantum cryptography.

Our platform is designed to help researchers stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field, and connect with others working on similar topics. Whether you are a seasoned expert or just starting out on your journey in cryptography research, we welcome you to join us and be a part of the vibrant community of researchers here at Cryptography Researchers of India.
