Having a curated list of cryptographers in India is essential for several reasons.

Firstly, India is a vast country with a diverse and thriving research community. However, the lack of a comprehensive list can often be a bottleneck for collaboration and interdisciplinary research. By creating a centralized platform that brings together researchers from various corners of the country, we aim to facilitate communication and collaboration within the community.

This is particularly important for early stage researchers or graduate students, who may not be aware of the full extent of possibilities within the field of cryptography in India. A list such as this can help them connect with others working on similar topics, and expand their knowledge and understanding of the field.

Overall, the goal of this list is to contribute to the advancement of cryptography research in India, and ultimately to the benefit of society as a whole. We hope that this platform will serve as a valuable resource for researchers in the field, and encourage collaboration and innovation within the community.
